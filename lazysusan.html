      <h1>Where do you want to eat?</h1>
      <p>I’ve never figured out how to answer this question no matter how many times I’ve heard it. I love exploring food and eating out, but deciding is just so hard. Whether I’m out to eat with friends or on a date, it’s always “whatever you prefer.”</p>
      <p>As a virtual assistant making this case study, one of my tasks included finding restaurants depending on the client’s preferences. Turns out I wasn’t the only one having problems with deciding where to eat. It was proved to be true by potential users I conducted user interviews with–- 5 individuals who eat out at least once a week, 3 individuals who often travel and eat out, and 2 users who have food allergies and/or restrictions.</p>

        <h1>The conundrum of indecisiveness </h1>
        <p>Confirming it was a problem was one thing, figuring out why it is is another. It’s much of a problem when you’re on a first date with someone you just met on Bumble and you two awkwardly hope one of you comes up with a restaurant you both would like. Yet, it’s so easy to decide and swipe whether I like them or not. And then it just came to me: swiping. I needed to know more about swiping, what makes it effective, and why it’s the solution to getting stuck in a decision.</p>

      <div class="main-content">
        <h1>Do you want to eat here?</h1>
        <p>This brings us to the solution to our problem. The swiping interface, as I found out, employs a variable reward schedule, reinforcing a behavior after a random number of responses in anticipation of the reward. It’s intuitive and natural to the user which adds up as key to retaining the user’s attention. It also helps overcome choice paralysis by presenting the user with one option at a time, turning “Where do you want to eat?” to “Do you want to eat here?”</p>

        <h1>What’s out there?</h1>
        <p>As I’ve mentioned before, my job responsibilities included finding restaurant recommendations. Two of my go-to tools are Google Maps and Yelp as they provide recommendations alongside information that are essential deciding factors for my clients. Besides what I’ve gathered from the user research, I conducted a competitive audit of apps or websites that help in finding restaurant recommendations.</p>

      <div class="main-content">
        <h1>Information at a glance</h1>
        <p>With the data from the research conducted, it would be useful for the users to see information at a glance to further help them decide whether they like a restaurant or not. This solution helps those who have certain dietary restrictions and preferences towards specific cuisines and are influenced by whether the food or the restaurant itself is post-worthy or not (of course, that’s just as relevant!)</p>

    <div class="main-content">
      <h1>When you’re REALLY that indecisive</h1>
      <p>Having indecisiveness in mind while making the design, the users swiping right doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to be stuck with that choice. Users have the option to add a restaurant they like to a feature called list, where you can add restaurants and categorize them then go back to whenever you like. But if the users are set to a certain restaurant, they can easily get directions and view them on Google Maps.</p>

    <div class="main-content">
      <h1>Fifty Shades of Hunger</h1>
      <p>Finally, for the visual design, users who will be using the app will most likely be hungry and on the lookout for what and where to eat, so I chose colors that are bright and are usually associated with food. I used a bold sans-serif typeface for the heading and a regular sans-serif typeface for the body because this app is meant to be straightforward, and so should the design.</p>
