      <h1>User Research</h1>
      <p>This study used existing user interviews for a cafe as the basis. Before the research, I assumed that customers have problems mostly during the ordering phase at cafes. However, upon conducting research, it turns out that frustrations extend beyond simply ordering. Based on the user interviews, I was able to sum it up into two user personas.</p>
		<div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-a.webp" alt=""/> </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Besides the user persona, I wanted to get more in-depth into how the user does and feels when ordering at a coffee shop, so I made a user journey map based on Lia’s user persona. Doing this allows me to understand the user more and identify problems to consider when designing the app. After all, the main goal of this case study is to improve the user experience.</p>

        <h1>Starting the Design </h1>
        <p>I’ve identified the problems that needed to be solved with the design, so it’s now time to move on to actually solving them. I already have the solutions and features pictured in my brain; I just needed to write everything down. Here, I created the information architecture and categorized them based on what screen they’d be present at. I categorized it further by circling it in different colors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-c.webp" width="2000px" class="image-fluid" alt=""/> </div>
    </div>
		      <p>I now moved on to turning the information into visual representation: paper wireframes. (Fun but obvious fact: I didn’t do it on paper). I think making paper wireframes is fun and effective because it just lets you dump ideas that you just want to get out of your brain right away.</p>
      
      <div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-d.webp" width="2000px" class="image-fluid" alt=""/> </div>

	      <p>And what’s a (fictional) cafe without a menu? Since this case study is for a French Patisserie, I did my research on popular patisserie options, including what flavors they usually come in, and of course, I gotta include coffee. When I think of patisseries, I always imagine cozy vintage-looking, Rococo-inspired visuals. So I considered all of these when I created the menu illustrations.</p>
    
      <div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-e.webp" width="2000px" class="image-fluid" alt=""/> </div>
  
	      <p>I got started then on making the design system. I stuck with a color palette that is widely inspired by pastries, also considering the style I had in mind when I made the illustrations. Since this app is specific to a cafe, I wanted to defeat the norm by making the design as unique to the cafe as possible, even if it’s fictional. I wanted the design to give the feel that it’s handmade, like the illustrations looking like they’re hand-painted, so I wanted every element as much as possible to look like they’re hand-drawn or handwritten. I initially wanted a cursive font for the brand but decided against it. I also started making the necessary components to make the prototype as dynamic and functional as possible, and I added more as I continued on the prototype.</p>

        <h1>Refining the Design</h1>
        <p>To start with the prototype, I created the home screen. Despite the app solving common user problems, there should be another motivation for the user to download and use the app. Besides the user benefitting from it, I wanted the business to benefit from it too by attracting more customers. So I added a feature where the user gets a reward after a certain number of orders using the app, which has been done by other cafes as well.</p>
     
      <div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-g.gif" width="2000px" class="image-fluid" alt=""/> </div>
		    <p>The order screen is the most crucial part of this case study. This is where most of the problems we’ve identified earlier are to be solved, besides most of the app’s necessary functions. We wanted a feature that allows ordering even while seated and a feature that allows reservation of seats for users like Ali (fig. 1). We also want a feature that allows ordering by group which can then be ordered at a specific time for users like Lia (fig. 2).</p>
     
      <div class="project-image"> <img src="../images/purblecakes-h.gif" width="2000px" class="image-fluid" alt=""/> </div>
	  
 		    <p>And what’s an order screen if we can’t place an order? On the same screen, we can scroll vertically to see all the items and horizontally to see an item’s available flavors (fig. 3). We simply click the Plus button to add an item to our bag (fig. 4). Once items are added, we can view our bag and modify our orders and place it once done. After ordering, we go back to the home screen where we can see the order status (fig. 5).</p>

        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
        <p>Initially, this case study intends to improve user experience, but the users don’t just consist of customers—it also includes the business, or Purble Cakes for this case. I designed this app to do just that. I wanted the app to have value propositions not present in other similar apps. One that doesn’t just consider individuals but also groups, which are often disregarded even though it’s more frequent that cafe orders are done by groups. These value propositions don’t just make customers’ lives easier, they also lead to the business attracting more.</p>
