	<p><b>Where do you want to eat?</b>--a simple question I've heard a million times, yet I've never figured out to answer right away. Minds change, moods change, locations change, and the people you eat with change! There are just so many factors to consider and a lot of brainpower we'd rather use for a different purpose. Where do you want to eat? Maybe the answer lies not in answering the question but rather in asking the right question: do you want to eat here?</p>

<p><b>Meet Lazy Susan!</b></p>
	<p>A restaurant generator app that helps you decide where to eat--just swipe and dine! It has features that answer the problems to questions that hold us back from deciding where to eat. The app does the same thing as its namesake, it provides convenience with a motion of your hand, serving just what you want.</p>

<p><b>The Charts Don’t Lie.</b></p>
	<p>For this case study, I've asked the help of 10 potential users belonging to three different groups: users who eat out at least once a week, users who travel and eat out, and users who have food allergies or restrictions. After scouring the World Wide Web for the answers to my whys, I found the biggest culprit of them all! As it turns there’s a term for one of the biggest problems our users face and it’s called <i>choice paralysis</i>.</p>

	<p><b>Yes, And; No, But…
</b></p>
	<p>Let's be real, we're not <i>that</i> indecisive <i>(right?)</i>, there's just a multitude of questions we ask ourselves before we’re able to say “That’s the one I want!” Heck, we sometimes find it easier to decide what we don’t want! These features answer the questions you didn’t even know you needed to know the answers to. And just like Susan, if you’re feeling lazy, let the app surprise you!</p>

	<p><b>The Star of the Show.</b></p>
	<p>Believe it or not, the inspiration for this app’s interface didn’t come from food or restaurant apps. Besides my dedication to food, literally dedicating a big chunk of my life studying its essence, I got inspired by something completely unrelated–dating apps! The star of the show, the swiping interface present mostly in popular dating apps, employs a variable reward schedule, reinforcing a behavior after a random number of responses in anticipation of the reward. The anticipation of the reward, finding a restaurant you could eat at, releases dopamine, making the seemingly dreadful task of deciding fun and exciting.</p>

<div class="pd-body">
	<p><b>Extra! Extra! Extra!</b></p>

	<p>We’ve solved the biggest problem of it all and even made it an enjoyable experience for our users but we don’t stop there. Swiping is a fun experience, but users would need help organizing previous preferences so they can refer to them again. Plus, deciding on a restaurant doesn’t end with merely deciding, users would want to know how to get there. These features conclude the extra features of the app for a more organized no-longer-indecisive dining experience.</p>
